# Disease prediction using R
The aim of this project is to produce a model that will be able to predict (and classify) an individual's risk of certain diseases using [Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey data](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2020.html). This model will allow insurance companies to assess the risk of potential customers in order to adjust insurance premium costs. It will also allow medical practices to identify patients for early intervention. The diseases that will be predicted are:<br />
- Coronary heart disease and myocardial infarction (CHD and MI)
- Kidney Disease
- Skin cancer
- Other cancers
- Diabetes
- Asthma
- Arthritis

**Please refer to the report for a complete understanding of this project**

## Models used
Three decision tree models were used to get optimal predictions for each disease including:
- Random Forests
- C5.0
- XGBoost<br />

A neural network was also implemented to compare the performance metrics of decision trees to a more complex approach.
